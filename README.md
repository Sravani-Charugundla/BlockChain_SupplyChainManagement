# BlockChain based  Supply Chain Management System for Army Service Corps
This repository contains the source code for a React-based supply chain management system.

# Features
### User Authentication:
The system offers robust user authentication, allowing individuals to securely sign up, log in, and manage their accounts, ensuring data privacy and access control.
### Product Management: 
Users can efficiently manage products within the supply chain, including adding, editing, and deleting items as necessary, facilitating streamlined inventory control 
### Order Tracking: 
It includes comprehensive order tracking capabilities, enabling users to monitor orders at various stages of the supply chain process, enhancing transparency and efficiency.
### Inventory Management: 
The system assists users in managing inventory levels and stock movements, optimizing resource utilization and minimizing stockouts or overstock situations.



# How Blockchain Can Improve the Supply Chain Industry

Blockchain technology offers several advantages that can significantly enhance the supply chain industry:

### Transparency and Traceability: 
Blockchain provides a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions, enabling stakeholders to track products from the point of origin to the final destination . This transparency helps in identifying inefficiencies, reducing counterfeiting, and ensuring compliance with regulations.
### Security: 
The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures enhanced security by encrypting data across multiple nodes, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized parties to tamper with information [4]. This reduces the risk of data breaches and fraudulent activities, safeguarding sensitive supply chain data.
### Efficiency and Cost Savings:
By eliminating intermediaries and automating processes through smart contracts, blockchain streamlines supply chain operations, reducing administrative costs and transaction times [3]. Additionally, the real-time visibility provided by blockchain allows for better inventory management, minimizing inventory holding costs and reducing the occurrence of stockouts or overstock situations.
### Enhanced Collaboration: 
Blockchain facilitates secure and transparent collaboration among supply chain partners, enabling seamless sharing of information while preserving data privacy [5]. This fosters trust among participants and promotes smoother coordination across the entire supply chain network.

### Overall, blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the supply chain industry by enhancing transparency, security, efficiency, and collaboration.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
